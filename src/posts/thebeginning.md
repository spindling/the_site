## My second attempt

I've been trying to learn how to make a website. Specifically, this blog.

Methods for building a website range from what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WSIWYG) tools like Wordpress and hand-coding HTML for each page. Static site generators are often suggested as a middle ground between these two extremes.

So I embarked on my quest. Eleventy (11ty) is a static site generator (SSG) like the popular tools Jekyll and Hugo. It seemed like it would be a good introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript due to its simplicity and flexiblity.

Hoo-wee, I could not have been more wrong. But this is not Eleventy's fault. I simply don't have the coding skills just yet. After trying the excellent [Learn Eleventy](https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev/) tutorials, I was deep in the weeds and eyeing Wordpress once more. 

So I'm taking a step back. I'll attempt to learn each part separately, starting with HTML and CSS.

It's similar to purchasing a fixer-upper house and doing the renovations yourself... while living in it. Now, real-estate isn't really in the cards for most people of my generation, but you get the point. There is a definite satisfaction in trying to build something piece by piece. It comes out personalized, and there's a chance to learn plenty of interesting things along the way.

I often tend to find myself hesitating to start a new project because I don't feel like I know enough about the topic. However, as in most cases with self-learning, it is difficult to know what you don't know. So here's my second attempt at building a blog with Eleventy.
